## Why FreeBSD

I have been using Linux since 2002 about time I was 14 years old. I attempted to my first Linux install from floppies without internet. I recall floppies were from Redhat book which I loaned from local small town library. Can't remember version though. 
Containers are pretty popular these days with Kubernetes and all the cloud services offering to run them for you.
